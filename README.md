# Time-LLM-for-Pest-Prediction
Implementing the TIME-LLM model in agricultural context, for predicting pest associated weather parameters.

Agricultural practices face ongoing challenges in managing pest-related risks, where the intricate
relationship between weather parameters and pest occurrences plays a pivotal role. To address
this, the overarching objective is to deploy a sophisticated multivariate time series prediction
model for forecasting weather parameters crucial to integrated pest management. Within this
context, this project specifically delves into the implementation of Time-LLM, a novel approach
proposed in the research paper titled ’TIME-LLM: Time Series Forecasting by Reprogramming
Large Language Models’, ICLR 2024 [Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01728)
